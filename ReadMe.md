# Problem 02 How Many Letters Do You See

Given a string, count the number of times a letter appears, and return it in a string.

This is a perfect reason to use a TreeMap

Examples 01

```java
String word = "aabbbcc";
String expected = "a:2 b:3 c:2";
```

Examples 02

```java
String word = "abcdefaabbccdd";
String expected = "a:3 b:3 c:3 d:1 e:1 f:1";
```

# Problem 03

## Number to String

Given an String array of numbers between 0 and 20, return a Integer array of the Integer representation of those numbers.

### Example 01

```
Given the input : ["zero", "one", "two", "three", "four"]
The expected output would be : [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
```

### Example 02

```
Given the input : ["zero", "nine", "eight", "two"]
The expected output would be : [ 0, 9, 8, 2]
```
